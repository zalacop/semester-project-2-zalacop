## Mad Bids

This is an auction website created for a school assignment, where users can search through listings whether they are logged in or not. If logged in, they can view the bid history on a listing, bid on a listing, create a new listing, and change their avatar image. Upon registration, users are given 1000 credits that they can use to bid on listings, and they can get credits by selling items
